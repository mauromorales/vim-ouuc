ouuc.vim
=========

The idea of this plugin came from using [TwitVim]( https://github.com/vim-scripts/TwitVim ).
I wanted a way to open the URLs in the feed. There is another plugin
called OpenUrl but I wanted to be able to open the URL under the 
cursor and not just the first one in line.

The plugin only works with Safari on Mac OSX though you may customize
it to your needs.

Installation
------------

    git clone git://github.com/mauromorales/vim-ouuc.git

Place the file under plugin into your .vim/plugin folder

Contributing
